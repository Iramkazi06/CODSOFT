(Level 1)

Task 1:- LANDING PAGE A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills, encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

Task 2:- PORTFOLIO PAGE Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development project. Header Section: Add your name or a logo at the top. Optionally, include a brief introduction or tagline. About Section: Insert an image of yourself. Write a short bio highlighting your skills and experience. Skills Section: List your key skills or areas of expertise. Projects Section: Showcase samples of your work or projects. Include project titles, descriptions, and images. Resume Section: Provide a link to download your resume in PDF format. Contact Section: Include your contact information, such as email address and phone number.

Task 3:- CALCULATOR To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
